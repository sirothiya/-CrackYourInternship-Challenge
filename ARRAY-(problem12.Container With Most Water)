Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104


/////MY SOLUTION
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
       int n=height.size();
        int maxarea=0;
        int low=0,high=n-1;
        while(low<high){
            maxarea=max(maxarea,(min(height[low],height[high])*(high-low)));
                        
            if(height[low]>height[high])
                       high--;
                       
            else 
                        low++;
        }
        return maxarea;
    }
};
