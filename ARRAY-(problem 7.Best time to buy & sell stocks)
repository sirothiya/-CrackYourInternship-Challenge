Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Constraints:
1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
     int minimum=INT_MAX;
        int max=0;
        int n=prices.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(minimum>prices[i])
                minimum=prices[i];
            else if((prices[i]-minimum)>max)
                max=prices[i]-minimum;
        }
        return max;
    }
};
